This is Aerial, a single page, single screen responsive site template. Real simple.
Makes heavy use of CSS animation (something I've been messing with a lot lately).
Should work well as a landing page that just directs folks to your stuff elsewhere
on the www. Sass sources are also included, so if you've never used Sass and you're
interested in giving it a try, head on over to sass-lang.com (and if not, you can
safely delete the "sass/" folder).

The scrolling mountainous background was derived from "Icefields" by Ryan Schroeder,
a talented photographer from Vancouver who graciously released it on Unsplash under
the CC0 license. Be sure to check out his other stuff over at flickr (link below)
as well as all the other kickass CC0-licensed images at Unsplash (unsplash.com).

Questions/comments/issues = just email or find me on Twitter. Have fun!
