To change the background image, modify the image url in line 229 of css/main.css:
 background: #348cb2 url("images/bg.jpg") bottom left;

Make sure the image is:
- Horizontally tileable.
- Wide and short.
- About 1500px wide.
- Fades to a solid color either at the top of bottom (which is used to fill the empty space above or below your image).
